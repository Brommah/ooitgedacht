## Design Principles

1. **"Geen verrassingen"** - No surprises. Every cost, delay, and decision should be visible before it happens.

2. **"Iedereen in de loop"** - Everyone in the loop. All stakeholders see the same truth.

3. **"Eén klik minder"** - One click less. Reduce friction at every step.

4. **"Nederlands, geen jargon"** - Plain Dutch, no jargon. Translate construction-speak.

5. **"Bewijs over vertrouwen"** - Proof over trust. Everything is documented, verified, timestamped.

6. **"Homie helpt"** - Homie helps. AI should anticipate needs, not wait to be asked.
